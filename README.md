## laba1 Algorithms for rasterization of graphic primitives 

**Purpose:** 
to get acquainted with the methods of rasterization of graphic primitives in practical experience.

**Problem statement:**
Programmatically implement algorithms for rasterization of segments and circles using pseudo-pixels of size NxN.

**Algorithms for rasterization:**
- algorithm CDA (digital differential analyzer, DDA) for rasterization of the segment;
- Brezenham algorithms for rasterization of a segment and a circle;
- Wu algorithm for rasterization of a segment.

**Tasks for laboratory work:**
1. Display the results of each of the algorithms under consideration on the monitor screen.
2. Evaluate the speed of each of the algorithms for rasterization of segments.
3. Play your own name on the monitor screen.
